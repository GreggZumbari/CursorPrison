# CursorPrison
This is a quick program made in AutoHotKey which locks the mouse cursor in place, and little else.

## Why did you make this code?

Myself and a friend of mine were trying to speedrun Borderlands GOTY on Steam as a fun pasttime, and to record how quickly we could do it, I used a program called LiveSplit. LiveSplit is basically just a very nice program which allows the user to overlay an accurate timer on top of their game, allowing them to see the timer and their game at the same time. The problem is that as I look around in the world, my cursor is moving around "behind the scenes", and every once in a while my cursor would make it to where the timer is. If I clicked my mouse at the same time that my cursor was over the timer, then I would click the timer instead of the game, which was a massive problem for our speedrunning. After looking online and finding no real solutions, I decided to take matters into my own hands and code something of my own. I hope that the few people in my same position can find this and make use of it!

## How to use the program
The default key to enable/disable the cursor lock is **TAB**, and the program can be terminated at any time by pressing **ScrollLock**.
