# CursorPrison
This is a quick program made in AutoHotKey which locks the mouse cursor in place, and little else.

## Why did you make this code?

Myself and a friend of mine were trying to speedrun Borderlands GOTY on Steam as a fun pasttime, and to record how quickly we could do it, I used a program called LiveSplit. LiveSplit is basically just a very nice program which allows the user to overlay an accurate timer on top of their game, allowing them to see the timer and their game at the same time. The problem is that as I look around in the world, my cursor is moving around "behind the scenes", and every once in a while my cursor would make it to where the timer is. If I clicked my mouse at the same time that my cursor was over the timer, then I would click the timer instead of the game, which was a massive problem for our speedrunning. After looking online and finding no real solutions, I decided to take matters into my own hands and code something of my own. I hope that the few people in my same position can find this and make use of it!

In my small amount of experience, AutoHotKey can be quite unreliable and buggy at times. There were several moments when I considered calling my neighbor Jerry to come destroy my PC. I found that at times, the exact same program can have different outputs on different computers. So, if you try my program and it doesn't work, either feel free to tinker with it yourself, or shoot me a message telling me about what happened and I can try to fix it for you if I am not busy! :)

## How to use the program
The default key to enable/disable the cursor lock is **TAB**, and the program can be terminated at any time by pressing **ScrollLock**. 
The main reason for there being a way to enable and disable the cursor lock is one, sometimes I might need to tab out to do something else, and having the cursor locked during that would make that much harder, and two, because sometimes I need to get into my inventory! I like to use the TAB button to get to inventory in Borderlands, but you can change it in the code to be whatever you personally like to use.
